# weather-app

## Description:
Check the current weather of a given location by searching for a city. Building this mini project helped solidify key concepts of writing asynchronous Javascript and retreiving data from an API by using async/await, promises, and callbacks. This project also (unintentionally) provided a lot of good practice using NPM and Webpack. When the app was completed and deployed to gh-pages, the index.html page in the /dist directory was not being displayed becuase the files were not being bundled properly (Webpack not set up correctly in the beginning). Through a tedious process of troubleshooting, Webpack was finally properly implemented to deploy the project. The take-away was a much deeper understanding of Webpacks functionality.

## Lessons Learned: 

* Using async/await to write asyncronous JS
* Fetching data from an API, processing the data, then displaying relevant information in the UI
* Deeper understanding of JSON files including JSON files receieved from an API as well as setting up a package.JSON file for a project
* Using webpack to bundle seperate ES6 modules, CSS stylesheets, and assets
* Using webpack to build a /dist folder with a production-ready version of the project
* How to implement a loading animation while fetching data

## Project Features: 
* View current weather information info for nearly any location worldwide
* Toggle the temperatures between Fahrenheit to Celsius 
* Coming soon: display additional weather info by clicking on the card to view the back side
